## Overview  
This project is part of a **Front-End Skill Assessment** focused on customizing and extending the **Mazer Bootstrap 5 Admin Dashboard**.  

The goal was to:  
- Modify the **UI/UX** of the existing template.  
- Replace static values with **dynamic, data-driven components**.  
- Use **JSON (mock APIs)** for real-world simulation.  
- Ensure the dashboard is **fully responsive and visually consistent**.

## Step-by-Step Work  

1. **Project Setup** – Forked the Mazer template and configured with **Vite** for local development and hot reload.  
2. **UI/UX Updates** – Improved layout, sidebar, navbar, card styles, and hover effects for a modern look.  
3. **Dynamic Data Integration** –  
   - Added `data.json` containing profile views (monthly), regional data, and gender distribution.  
   - Fetched JSON data via JavaScript and dynamically updated dashboard elements.  
4. **Charts Integration** –  
   - Updated bar, line, and pie charts to render values directly from `data.json`.  
   - Ensured charts are interactive and responsive.  
5. **Mock APIs** – Used local JSON as API endpoints to simulate real data flow.  
6. **Testing & Responsiveness** – Verified UI/UX across desktop, tablet, and mobile.

## Tools / Help Used  
- **Bootstrap 5** – Grid system, utilities, and components.  
- **Chart.js** – For rendering interactive charts dynamically.  
- **Mazer Dashboard Template** – Base template for customization.  
- **ChatGPT** – Assisted with JavaScript logic for data binding.  
- **VS Code & Live Server** – For coding, debugging, and testing.

## Learning & Outcome  
- Gained experience in **customizing an existing template** instead of starting from scratch.  
- Practiced **dynamic data binding** with JSON and JavaScript.  
- Improved **dashboard UI/UX design and responsiveness**.  
- Learned how to use **mock APIs** to simulate real-world API integration.
